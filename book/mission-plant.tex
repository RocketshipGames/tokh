\emph{\emph{Plant} is a RECON+ mission played on a~2'x3' play area.}


\section{Play Area}

\noindent
Whichever player takes Deployment in the Initiative Roll chooses a
corner of the play area for their Deployment Zone, from which the
latter extends~12'' out.  The other player takes the diagonally
opposite corner as their Deployment Zone, again up to~12'' out.

A Network Terminal is placed at the center of the play area.

\section{Mission Rules}
As part of their deployment, both players secretly choose and record~3
scenery pieces wholly within~24'' of their opponent's Deployment Zone
corner as Vulnerable Infrastructure.  Each piece must have a footprint
of at least~4 square inches (e.g., a 2''x2'' square or~2.5'' diameter
circle).

In addition, as part of deployment, three troopers in each player's
army are given D-Charges.  This is public information as usual.
D-Charges already included in troopers' profiles may also be used.
