\emph{\emph{Plant} is a RECON+ mission in which the alliances attempt
  to destroy the campus physical plant using explosives chosen to
  incriminate their opponents, while preventing being similarly
  implicated themselves.}

Whichever player takes Deployment in the Initiative Roll chooses a
corner of the play area for their Deployment Zone, from which the
latter extends~12'' out.  The other player takes the diagonally
opposite corner as their Deployment Zone, again up to~12'' out.

A Network Terminal is placed at the center of the play area.

The centerline of the play area for purposes of Infiltration and other
rules is the diagonal line between the non-deployment corners.

\section{Mission Rules}
As part of their deployment, both players secretly choose and record~3
scenery pieces with their majority within~24'' of their opponent's
Deployment Zone corner as Vulnerable Infrastructure.  Each piece must
have a footprint of at least~4 square inches (e.g., a 2''x2'' square
or~2.5'' circle).

In addition, as part of deployment, three troopers in each player's
army are given D-Charges.  This is public information as usual.
D-Charges already included in troopers' profiles may also be used.

\section{Scoring}

Players may score up to~10 objective points via the following
conditions:
\begin{squishitemize}
\item 1pt for each D-Charge you place on your chosen Vulnerable
  Infrastructure.
\item 1pt for each D-Charge you detonate on your chosen Vulnerable
  Infrastructure.
\item 3pts if you detonate D-Charges on all of your chosen Vulnerable
  Infrastructure simultaneously.

\item 1pt if more points of the opposing army list have been destroyed.
\end{squishitemize}
