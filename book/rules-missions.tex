\chapter{Mission Rules}

The following rules apply to each mission and squad progression between rounds.

\missionrule{Initiative Roll.}  A standard Initiative Roll determines
Initiative and Deployment, except the Initiative Roll may be made
against either your Lieutenant or your Special Agent.  In addition, in
the Quadrant missions:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item The player that chose the mission receives a +3 MOD.

\item Players whose alliance controls the associated Breach Point or
  Quadrant receive a~+3 MOD.
\end{squishitemize}

\missionrule{Connect Objective.} The Connect Objective short skill may
be applied to objectives in some missions:

  \textsc{Requirements}
  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item The user must be a model (not a marker) in base contact with a
    designated objective.
  \end{squishitemize}

      \textsc{Effects}
      \begin{squishitemize}
      \item The user makes a Normal WIP roll with a~-3 MOD to attempt
        connecting the objective.  \emph{Specialist Troops
          automatically pass this roll.}

      \item If successful, the acting player connects to the objective
        (mark it appropriately) and the other player is no longer
        connected if they previously were (remove any marker).
      \end{squishitemize}
    \end{minipage}}
\end{minipage}}}

\missionrule{Network Terminals.}  The Connect Objective short skill
may be applied to Network Terminals.  At the end of each game round,
if your Special Agent is in base contact with a Network Terminal you
have connected, not a marker, and no enemy troops are in contact, you
receive a Network Directory token.

\missionrule{Endgame.}  All matches end after~3 game turns.
\emph{Retreat!} rules apply as given in the main \emph{Infinity}
rulebook except the game does not end once one player has no models in
play: The remaining player may play out the game turns attempting to
score objectives.
