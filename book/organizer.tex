\chapter{Organizers' Note}

No reason organizers can't play, they don't need to make any decisions
where bias factors in.

 group's armies permit):

Doors open at 11am, players must be present by 11:50, dice start
rolling at noon! There will be a short break before the final round to
get dinner on your own. We will conclude by 9pm.

[one 90 minute RECON+ round]
[two 90 minute RECON+ rounds]
[one 2.5 hour RECON+ doubles round]

\section{Players}

(some players might field two lists on their own for the doubles game if we have uneven numbers)

Players can join or drop between rounds without much hassle Won't
affect the campaign Might want to give them some free campaign
progressions, though they're not decisive enough to matter too much

\section{Prizes}

All entry fees go toward store credit prizes. Awards will be given for
standings within each alliance and in-game achievements as
participation permits. There will also be an army painting vote and
prize (or more than one, as participation permits), so get your squad
done up real pretty! You must put at least your Strike Team Core on
display for this competition, but may include troopers from your other
lists as you wish.
