\chapter{Common Rules}

\missionrule{Initiative Roll.}  A standard Initiative Roll determines
Initiative and Deployment, except the Initiative Roll may be made
against either your Lieutenant or your Special Agent.  In addition, in
the Quadrant missions:

\begin{itemize}\shortlist
\item The player that chose the mission receives a +3 MOD.

\item Players whose alliance controls the associated Breach Point or
  Quadrant receive a~+3 MOD.
\end{itemize}

\missionrule{Connect Objective.} The Connect Objective short skill is
available in some missions:

  \medskip
  \textsc{Requirements}
  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item The user must be a model (not a marker) in base contact with a
    designated objective.
  \end{squishitemize}

  \colorbox{Gray!24}{\begin{minipage}{\linewidth-2\fboxsep}

  \medskip      
      \textsc{Effects}
      \begin{squishitemize}
      \item The user makes a Normal WIP roll with a~-3 MOD to attempt
        connecting the objective.  \emph{Specialist Troops
          automatically pass this roll.}

      \item If successful, the acting player connects to the objective
        (mark it appropriately) and the other player is no longer
        connected if they previously were (remove any marker).
      \end{squishitemize}
    \end{minipage}}
\end{minipage}}}
\hfill\hbox to 0pt{}

\medskip
\missionrule{Network Terminals.}  The Connect Objective short skill
may be applied to Network Terminals in all missions.  At the end of
each game round, if a player has a Specialist Troop model (not a
marker) in base contact with a Network Terminal they have connected,
and no enemy troops are in base contact, the player receives a Network
Directory token.  If that troop is their Special Agent, they receive
two tokens.

\missionrule{Experience.}  After each mission, your Special Agent is
permanently improved by choosing from:

\begin{itemize}\shortlist
\item +1 to one of CC, BS, PH, or WIP
\item +1 to MOV (first value)
\item +1 to ARM (once per campaign)
\item +1 to BTS (once per campaign)
\end{itemize}

If you won and the Lieutenant listed on your army list survived, their
CC, BS, PH, or WIP may be permanently improved by~+1.  You may not
improve a single attribute for any given Lieutenant more than once per
campaign (e.g., after two victorious missions they could not have
improved BS twice).
  
If you lost the mission, you receive a Karma token.  If you lost by~7
or more objective points then you receive two Karma tokens.  Karma
tokens may be discarded at any point in a later mission to reroll a
single die of yours.  You may not reroll a die that has already been
rerolled.
