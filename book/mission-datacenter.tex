The Deployment Zones are~12'' areas along opposing play area edges.

Nine Server objectives are placed in a grid: Three on the centerline
between the deployment zones, one at the center and the other two~12''
from each edge; and six in two lines of three~8'' from that centerline
in each half of the play area, each with one at the center and the
other two~12'' from each edge.

Each Server is randomly assigned a Data Topic without it being
revealed to either team, via markers placed facedown next to them.
There are three each of three Data Topics: Bio/Xeno, Cyber, and MechE.

Teams may look at the assigned Data Topic for any Server they have
connected at any time.  In addition, Network Directory tokens earned
by teams in the preceding missions may be discarded to look at the
assigned Data Topic for up to three Servers per token.  In neither
case are the Data Topics revealed to the other team.  Teams may keep
secret notes about what they have learned of the Servers.
