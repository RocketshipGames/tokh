\chapter{Mission: Breach Point}

\emph{\emph{Breach Point} is a RECON+ mission to secure an entry point
  into a quadrant of Dr.~Tokh's campus.}

\section{Play Area}

\noindent
Whichever player takes Deployment in the Initiative Roll chooses
either of the long edges of the play area as the Breach Point.

There is an Exclusion Zone~6'' along the the Breach Point edge extent.

The Deployment Zones are clipped triangles along the short edges
stretching from~3'' forward of that edge along the inner Exclusion
Zone boundary, to the point~12'' forward on the opposite edge of the
play area (this may also be measured by stretching a line from the
corner inside the Exclusion Zone to a point~12'' forward on the far
play area edge, with no models permitted to be deployed inside the
Exclusion Zone).

There are two scoring Sectors: The Target Sector, extending~6'' from
the Breach Point edge and~4'' on either side of the short centerline;
and the Approach Sector, extending~12'' from the Breach Point edge
and~9'' on either side of the short centerline but excluding the
Target Sector.

A Network Terminal is placed on the short center axis of the
table,~4'' from the long play area edge opposite the Breach Point
edge.

\item 2pt for having a model with more than half its base inside the
  Target Sector.
