\chapter{Mission: Bio/Xeno}

\emph{\emph{Bio/Xeno} is a RECON+ mission in which the alliances
  attempt to harvest experimental lifeforms crafted by Dr.~Tokh, some
  of the more dangerous of which have escaped amid the fighting!}

\section{Play Area}

\noindent
The Deployment Zones are~6'' areas along the short play area edges.

There is an Exclusion Zone extending~6'' on either side of the short
centerline of the play area~(12'' total, across the whole board).

%There is an Exclusion Zone extending~6'' on both sides of the short
%centerline of the play area (12'' across total) and covering the full
%extent between long edges.

Place two Stasis Chambers on the short centerline of the play area,
each~5'' from the center toward a different long edge~(10'' apart).

A Network Terminal is placed on the short centerline adjacent to a
long edge chosen by the player with Deployment before any deployment.

\section{Mission Rules}

As part of their deployment, each player places two Xenomorphs in
Hidden Deployment within the Exclusion Zone on their half of the play
area.  These do not join their army lists and are considered enemies
to both players.  The reactive player controls all revealed Xenomorphs
and may choose to ARO with the unrevealed Xenomorphs they placed.

\section{Scoring}

Players may score up to~10 objective points via the following
conditions at game end:
\begin{squishitemize}
\item 2pt for each Stasis Chamber you have connected.
\item 3pts for having at least one model in base contact with a
  Xenomorph in Immobilized state;\\
  OR 1pt for having at least one model in base contact with a
  Xenomorph in Unconscious state.
\item 2pt for having your Special Agent in base contact with an
  Immobilized or Unconscious 
  Xenomorph.

% \item 1pt if the opposing Special Agent is in a Null state or eliminated.
\item 1pt if more points of the opposing army list have been destroyed.
