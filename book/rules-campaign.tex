\chapter{Campaign Rules}

\missionrule{Experience.}  After each mission, your Special Agent is
permanently improved by choosing from:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item +1 to one of BS, PH, or WIP
\item +3 to CC
\item +1 to MOV (first value)
\item +1 to ARM (once per campaign)
\item +1 to BTS (once per campaign)
\end{squishitemize}

If you won and the Lieutenant on your army list survived, their BS,
PH, or WIP may be permanently improved by~+1, or their CC by~+3.  Note
that this is optional as attributes are public information, so an
improvement reveals your Lieutenant's identity.  You may not improve a
single attribute for any given Lieutenant more than once per campaign
(e.g., after two victories they could not improve BS twice).
  
If you lost the mission, you receive a Karma token.  If you lost by~7
or more objective points then you receive two Karma tokens.  Karma
tokens may be discarded at any point in a later mission to reroll a
single die of yours.  You may not reroll a die that has already been
rerolled.
